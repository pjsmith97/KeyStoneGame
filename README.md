# KeyStone Game
My coursework for my Advanced Games Technology course (INM710) at City, University of London. The working title I had for the game is 'Keystone'. The basic concept is the player steps into the role of an alien on a dying planet. The objective is to gather the keystones in order to save the world.

All files concerning the project are in the Keystone.zip file.

To play the game, run AGT_TEMPLATE/game/game.exe. Warning: game audio may be loud on some computers.

Controls:
W - Forward,
A - Left,
S - Backward,
D - Right,
Mouse - Rotate the camera,
Left mouse button - Shoot ‘teleportation orbs’,
Right mouse button - Camera Zoom,
Spacebar - Exit Stasis,
E - Jump

The basic mechanics of the game are as follows. When the player shoots orbs successfully at the floating ‘teleportation totems’, the player is teleported to the totem’s position and locked in a sort of stasis. In this stasis, the player cannot move save for the camera. This extends to the forces of gravity, allowing the player to venture to the higher levels of the map. To exit this stasis, the player can either press the spacebar to apply gravity again, or shoot a nearby totem to teleport to that location. Another mechanic is the ‘jump’ action, though this is only unlocked after the player successfully collects 3 Keystones and has a cooldown timer after every use.  The jump is fairly self explanatory, launching the player into the air with moderate force. However, its usefulness only comes when considering the enemies and the challenges they present. The other mechanic available to the player is the camera zoom. Mapped to the right mouse button, the player can apply a moderate zoom to their field of view. This makes it easier to target totems that are further away.

The goal of the game is to collect all six Keystones on the map as quickly as possible. The main mechanic is the teleportation, as it is required for the player to use in order to collect nearly every Keystone. The enemies of the level are there to make things generally more challenging and time inducing. They will block teleportation orbs and forcefully exit the player out of stasis, potentially costing them seconds they need for a better score.
